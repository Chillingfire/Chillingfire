## üòé About Me
Hello! My name is Daniel and I'm an aspiring software engineer in the greater Seattle area. I'm majoring in computer science and software engineering at the University of Washington Bothell, and I've been involved with software development for most of my life. I'm proficient in C++ and Java, but I also have experience with Python, cloud services, web development, and more. I also have experience with game development, using tools such as Unity and Blender.

  - Implemented a live operational dashboard service for AWS EC2 to allow operators to investigate packet loss
issues and conduct network analysis, resulting in a substantial reduction in troubleshooting times for packet
loss events that could potentially impact millions of EC2 users.
  - Utilized AWS S3, AWS EventBridge, AWS Glue, Spark, and Python to set up an automated ETL pipeline that
processes packet travel data from thousands of networking devices.
  - Established a visual dashboard front-end using AWS Athena, AWS Quicksight, and SQL to display up-to-date
packet travel metrics.

  - Designed and implemented a Python script to parse through software testing procedure documents for
automated testing, which also influenced the decision to create standardized testing procedure formats.
  - Evaluated the ability to install Syndesis, an open-source integration platform, onto a provisioned RKE2-based
Kubernetes cluster running internal security and monitoring software components.
